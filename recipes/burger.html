    <h3>Burgers</h3>
    <p>The secret to incredibly juicy burger patties is the addition of crushed crackers or breadcrumbs to hold in the natural fat and juices.</p>
    <p>We definitely recommend using crackers if you have them. Adding crushed crackers is an old-school method to add more flavor than plain breadcrumbs. Plus, it’s <strong>super handy</strong> for using up that package of crackers you’ve had sitting in the pantry for weeks.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Ground chuck</li>
        <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.
        </li>
        <li>Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties. Like so:
        </li>
        <li>Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F.
        </li>
    </ol>
