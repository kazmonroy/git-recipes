    <h3>French Fries (Baked or Fried!)</h3>
    <p>These <em>homemade</em> french fries are potatoes that are cut into sticks and deep fried until golden brown, then sprinkled with seasonings. Homemade fries are WAY better than anything you’d get at a restaurant, and are fun and easy to make</p>
    <p>You can never go wrong with potatoes as a side dish, whether it’s <strong>baked potato wedges, garlic mashed potatoes or these classic french fries.</strong> Pair your fries with a burger, or serve them with steak, and watch the rave reviews come in!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds Russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Oil for frying I use vegetable or peanut oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley optional</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into matchsticks, either with a knife or with a french fry cutter. The potato pieces should all be similar in size.</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Soak the potatoes for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the potatoes. Place the potatoes on a layer of paper towels and pat thoroughly with additional towels until dry.</li>
        <li>Pour 3 inches of oil into a large, deep pot. Heat the oil to 300 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Place about 1/3 of the potatoes in the pot, and cook until tender. This takes about 4-5 minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste over the fries. Add parsley if desired, then serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
