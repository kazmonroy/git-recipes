    <h3>Pizza with tomato and basil</h3>
    <p>A simple Caprese salad is one of my default dinners in August, so naturally, when I start craving more substantial meals in September, I turn to its heartier cousin: the Margherita pizza. </p>
    <p>Like Caprese salad, Margherita pizza stars fresh basil, mozzarella, and the best tomatoes you can find. It’s still a delicious, simple showcase of good quality produce, but the addition of crisp, chewy pizza crust, melty cheese, and warm sauce makes it a cozier, heartier meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>½ heaping cup Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh bocconcini mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>10 basil leaves</li>
        <li>Pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce onto the dough. Top with the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes and bake 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is browned. </li>
        <li>From the oven and top with fresh basil leaves and a pinch of red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with olive oil and serve.</li>
    </ol>
